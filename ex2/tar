1)   Read  https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/richard-bird/sudoku.pdf

make a running version of a Sudoku solver to find one solution + add your own heuristics.

 

2) Make a tree that describes mathematical expressions with 1 variable x

constants, x, +,-,^,*,/,sin,cos â€¦

Use Maybe so division by 0 is not a problem

           eval  ::: to evaluate at a given x

      differentiate ::: tree of derivative
